## Welcome to My Blog

This is my first blog post! I will just test functionality in this post, and write up how I implemented post functionality in a future post.

## Code Example

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")
    return True
```

### Lists

Unordered list:
- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

Ordered list:
1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item 

### Equations
This is an inline equation: $E = mc^2$.

In web animations, we often use trigonometric functions. The general form of a sine wave is:

$$
y(x,t) = A \sin(kx - \omega t + \phi)
$$

Where:
- $A$ is the amplitude
- $k$ is the wave number  
- $\omega$ is the angular frequency
- $\phi$ is the phase shift

This equation is perfect for creating smooth, natural animations in Three.js!

That's all for now!
