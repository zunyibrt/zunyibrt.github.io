I will just test functionality in this post, and write up how I implemented post functionality in a future post.\n\n## Code Example\n\n```python\ndef hello_world():\n    print(\"Hello, World!\")\n    return True\n``` \n\n## More Examples\n\n> This is a blockquote with some important information.\n\nCheck out [this link](https://example.com) for more info.\n\nHere's some **bold text** and *italic text*.\n\n### Lists\n\nUnordered list:\n- Item 1\n- Item 2\n- Item 3\n\nOrdered list:\n1. First item\n2. Second item\n3. Third item \n\n### Equations\nThis is an inline equation: $E = mc^2$.\n\nIn web animations, we often use trigonometric functions. The general form of a sine wave is:\n\n$$\ny(x,t) = A \\sin(kx - \\omega t + \\phi)\n$$\n\nWhere:\n- $A$ is the amplitude\n- $k$ is the wave number  \n- $\\omega$ is the angular frequency\n- $\\phi$ is the phase shift\n\nThis equation is perfect for creating smooth, natural animations in Three.js!\n\nThat's all for now!\n","title":"Hello World","date":"2025-07-06","excerpt":"This is my first blog post using react-markdown","tags":["react","nextjs","markdown"]}},"__N_SSG":true}
